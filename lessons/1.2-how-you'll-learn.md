This course will begin with a lot of code examples for you to type out. **Don't copy and paste these**. Manually typing them will help you get used to writing code.

Sometimes, you might be asked to type something without being shown what it does or why it works. Don't worry - to avoid overloading you, some more complicated concepts are kept back for later.

## Can I learn to code?
Almost certainly.

If you have basic maths skills, have ever learned a language (including your first language), and are able to type, you can probably learn to code.

It's just a matter of practice and motivation.

Computers weren't around for most of human history. No one is born with a talent for writing code. Everyone learns.

## What will I learn?
Over the next six months you will be introduced to a range of modules which will introduce you to different languages and concepts. The graphic below details this further:



## How are modules structured?
Each module contains two kinds of content:

* **Lessons** will teach you new concepts and reinforce these with short exercises. All the code you need to write is provided in the text of the lesson.
* **Project** tasks will show you how to apply the concepts we learn in each module to your own project. They are marked like this: <span class="project-badge">P</span>

<div class="todo">
		<h2>To do</h2>
		<p>Tasks for you to attempt will look like this.</p>
</div>

## What if I get stuck?
These lessons are intended for beginners, so we don't expect you to have any existing coding knowledge.

If you get stuck, go to the *#ddat-codelabs* channel on the cross-government digital Slack team. Your fellow learners and mentors are on this channel.

If you can't access to that Slack team, you can also email the [DDaT Codelabs volunteer team](ddatcodelabs@gmail.com).

If you are having trouble with a project task, you may find it useful to look at the code for an example app we built. You can copy this code if you need to, but we recommend writing your own.
