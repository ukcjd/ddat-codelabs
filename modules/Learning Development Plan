# The Learning Development Plan
## How You will Learn

<p class="lede"> The purpose of the Codelabs is to help instill confidence in you to work with the more technical aspects of working in
Digital Data and Technology. Indeed, we recognise that online learning may not be the preferred method for everyone therefore we have 
devised multiple methods to help maximise your opportunity to learn as you progress on your Codelabs journey. </p>

## Work at your own pace

## Work collaboratively 

## Work with a purpose
